# Project-05-Dynamic-Pricing-Engine-for-E-Commerce
An advanced, production-grade machine learning system that dynamically adjusts product prices in an e-commerce environment based on real-time demand, competition, seasonality, and user behaviour.  
This project simulates how modern retailers use AI to optimise pricing at scale, following end-to-end ML best practices using OOP, Docker, MLOps, and AWS.

### 🚀 Key Features

* 🔄 **Dynamic price prediction** using ML models (XGBoost, Time Series, RL)
* 🧱 **OOP-driven pipeline architecture** for modular and maintainable code
* 🐳 **Containerized training and inference** using Docker
* ⚙️ **CI/CD pipeline** using GitHub Actions + AWS ECR + ECS
* ☁️ **Deployment-ready** with AWS (S3, SageMaker, Lambda, ECS)
* 📊 **Interactive dashboard** using Streamlit for business visibility
* 🧪 **Experiment tracking** with MLflow
* 🔁 **Automated model retraining** with Airflow or Step Functions

### 📁 Tech Stack

* **Languages**: Python (OOP), SQL
* **ML**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Prophet, LightGBM
* **MLOps**: MLflow, Airflow, Docker, GitHub Actions
* **Cloud**: AWS (S3, ECS, Lambda, SageMaker, CloudWatch)
* **Visualization**: Streamlit, Plotly
